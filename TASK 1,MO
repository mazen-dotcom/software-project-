				Ascending order Program
The program purpose is to arrange number in ascending order 
Will explain the code step by step
1.	First we will ask the user to input the numbers he wants to arrange 


We will make array of type integer and make the user choose the size of array by doing for loop the user will be able to input the numbers
2.	We will create class of name Sorting and define the attributes and the constructor
3.	We Will Consider the first number the user put is already sorted and will begin our count and will use a for loop begin from the second number until I is greater size and inc 1 by one after every execution and assign that number in variable called temp and assign value of I in variable called j


4.We will do a while loop to check two conditions the
     4.1       first by making j>0 Be cause if j=0 that means we have checked the number in index test[i] with every element on its left
4.2	    Second condition we will check the swap condition if number in index test[j-1] is less than the number in on temp  we will do the swap 
4.3	Then we will decrease j by one so that helps to compare every number on left side of the number inside the temp
4.4	And last when we find the appropriate position we will put the number in temp in that position 
 
5.Finally we will do another for but this time it will output the numbers the user entered in their right position
